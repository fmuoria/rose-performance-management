### Changed

#### Performance Optimizations
- Separated CSS into external file with improved caching potential
- Separated JavaScript into external file with deferred loading
- HTML file size reduced from ~101 KB to ~11 KB
- External resources can be cached independently
- Page parsing and rendering can proceed without blocking on JavaScript

#### File Structure
- `index.html`: Now contains only semantic HTML markup (303 lines vs 2,346 lines)
- `styles.css`: Contains all application styles (630 lines, well-formatted)
- `app.js`: Contains all application logic (2,025 lines)
- `PERFORMANCE.md`: Existing server configuration documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md`: This file, documenting all changes

### Technical Details

#### Before Optimization
- Single `index.html` file: 101,396 bytes
- Inline minified CSS in `<style>` tags
- Inline JavaScript in `<script>` tags
- Total: 1 file, 2,346 lines

#### After Optimization
- `index.html`: 11,267 bytes (89% reduction)
- `styles.css`: 23,568 bytes (formatted, readable)
- `app.js`: 72,134 bytes
- Total: 3 files, better separation of concerns

#### Performance Benefits
1. **Better Caching**: CSS and JS files can be cached independently
2. **Parallel Loading**: Browser can download multiple resources simultaneously
3. **Faster Initial Parse**: HTML parsing completes quickly without inline scripts
4. **Deferred JavaScript**: Scripts load after HTML is parsed, improving perceived performance
5. **Maintainability**: Separate files are easier to edit, debug, and version control
6. **Compression**: Text-based files compress very well with Gzip/Brotli (see PERFORMANCE.md)

#### SEO Benefits
1. **Schema.org Markup**: Search engines better understand the application's purpose
2. **Enhanced Meta Tags**: Improved social media sharing with proper images
3. **Canonical URL**: Prevents duplicate content penalties
4. **Structured Data**: Enables rich snippets in search results
5. **Better Keywords**: More comprehensive keyword coverage

#### Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers support deferred scripts
- External stylesheets are universally supported
- Schema.org JSON-LD is supported by all major search engines
- Accessibility features work across all modern browsers and screen readers

### Recommendations for Further Optimization

#### Image Optimization (Future)
When adding images to the application:
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600">
</picture>
```

#### Server Configuration
See `PERFORMANCE.md` for:
- Gzip/Brotli compression setup
- Browser caching headers
- Security headers
- CDN configuration

#### Progressive Web App (Future)
Consider implementing:
- Service Worker for offline support
- Web App Manifest for installability
- Push notifications for feedback requests

### Testing Performed
- ✅ HTML structure validation
- ✅ CSS extraction and formatting
- ✅ JavaScript extraction
- ✅ File size reduction verification
- ✅ Accessibility attributes preserved
- ✅ SEO enhancements validated

### Notes
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to application behavior
- All inline event handlers maintained (onclick, onchange, onsubmit)
- Google Sign-In integration unchanged
- ARIA accessibility labels maintained
- Responsive design breakpoints preserved

### Migration Guide
No migration needed. The changes are purely structural:
1. HTML remains semantic and accessible
2. CSS styling is identical, just externalized
3. JavaScript functionality is unchanged
4. Server configuration in PERFORMANCE.md remains applicable
