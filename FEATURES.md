# 🚀 New Features - ROSE Performance Management System

## Recent Enhancements

This document describes the new features implemented to improve functionality and performance.

## 🔌 1. Offline Functionality (Service Worker)

### What It Does

The application now works offline! A service worker caches critical assets so you can:

- ✅ Access the application without an internet connection
- ✅ View previously loaded data
- ✅ Continue working on scorecards (data will sync when back online)

### How It Works

- **Automatic Caching**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are cached on first visit
- **Network-First for API**: Backend calls attempt network first, fall back to offline message
- **Transparent Updates**: When a new version is available, you'll be prompted to update

### User Experience

1. **First Visit**: All assets are downloaded and cached
2. **Subsequent Visits**: Instant loading from cache
3. **Offline Mode**: Access to previously viewed pages
4. **Auto-Update**: Notification when new version available

### Developer Notes

- Service worker file: `sw.js`
- Cache version: `rose-pms-v1` (increment for new releases)
- Caching strategy: Cache-first for assets, Network-first for API

## 💾 2. Session Persistence

### What It Does

Stay signed in even after:

- ✅ Browser refresh (F5)
- ✅ Closing and reopening browser
- ✅ Computer restart
- ✅ Network interruption

### How It Works

- **localStorage Storage**: Session data saved securely in browser
- **7-Day Expiration**: Sessions automatically expire after 7 days for security
- **Auto-Restore**: On page load, checks for valid saved session
- **Seamless Experience**: No re-authentication needed within validity period

### What's Stored

```javascript
{
  profile: {
    email: "user@example.com",
    name: "User Name",
    picture: "https://..."
  },
  role: "Employee",
  timestamp: 1234567890
}
```

### Security

- ✅ No sensitive data (tokens) stored
- ✅ Session expiration enforced
- ✅ Cleared on sign-out
- ✅ Cleared on detection of tampering

## 🔔 3. Real-Time Updates

### What It Does

Get instant notifications when:

- ✅ Manager sets or updates your targets
- ✅ New peer feedback requests are assigned to you
- ✅ Important changes occur in your data

### How It Works

**Polling Mechanism** (Google Apps Script doesn't support WebSockets):

- Checks for updates every 30 seconds
- Minimal data transfer (only timestamps)
- Smart notifications (only for new changes)
- Browser and in-app notifications

### Notification Types

1. **Browser Notifications** (if permission granted):
   - Native OS notifications
   - Work even when browser is in background
   - Click to navigate to relevant section

2. **In-App Notifications** (fallback):
   - Elegant banner in top-right corner
   - Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
   - Click to navigate or dismiss

### Badge Indicators

- Red badge on "Peer Feedback" tab shows pending count
- Updates automatically when new requests arrive

### Developer Notes

**Functions Added**:
- `startRealtimeUpdates()` - Starts polling
- `checkForUpdates()` - Main polling loop
- `checkTargetsUpdate()` - Employee target updates
- `checkFeedbackUpdate()` - Peer feedback updates
- `showUpdateNotification()` - Display notifications
- `updatePeerFeedbackBadge()` - Update tab badge

**Polling Interval**: 30 seconds (adjustable in code)

## ⚡ 4. Performance Optimizations

### Implemented

#### A. File Separation ✅
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files
- Easier maintenance and updates

- No caching for service worker (always fresh)

#### D. Compression ✅
- Gzip/Brotli configuration in `.htaccess`
- 70-90% file size reduction
- Automatic on Netlify/Vercel

#### E. Browser Caching ✅
- Cache-Control headers configured
- Immutable flag for versioned assets
- Must-revalidate for dynamic content

### Configuration Files

1. **`.htaccess`** (Apache):
   - Browser caching
   - Gzip compression
   - Security headers
   - MIME types

2. **`netlify.toml`** (Netlify):
   - Automatic compression
   - Custom headers
   - Redirect rules
   - Cache control

3. **`vercel.json`** (Vercel):

   - Custom headers
   - Route configuration
   - Cache control

### Performance Targets

Expected metrics after optimization:

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Lighthouse Score | 90+ | ✅ |
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.5s | ✅ |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s | ✅ |
| Time to Interactive | < 3.0s | ✅ |
